Well I've been hanging around this town too long
And it seems like every woman done me wrong
She's in love, but I'm in lust
Well the suitcases gatherin' dust
Baby, baby, baby, I'll see you some day

There ain't nothing good coming out of this situation
And if this is any kind of indication
Well love is not for me
And there's a hole new world to see
Baby, baby, baby, I'll see you some day

Too hip, gotta go
Too hip, gotta go
You ain't running my life no more

Too hip, gotta go
Too hip, gotta go
When I step foot out of this door

I won't even bother to pack
I'm gonna leave you sugar, never come back
Baby, baby, baby, I'll see you some day
Gotta go

Too hip, gotta go
Too hip, gotta go
You ain't running my life no more

Too hip, gotta go
Too hip, gotta go
When I step foot out of this door

I won't even bother to pack
I'm gonna leave you sugar, never come back
Baby, baby, baby, I'll see you some day
Baby, baby, baby, I'll see you some day
Baby, baby, baby, I'll see you some day

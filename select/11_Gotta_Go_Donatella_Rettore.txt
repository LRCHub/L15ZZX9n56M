Does it show, baby?
Gotta go
I don't feel, baby
Anymore
Gotta go, honey
Gotta go
And I'll put in my bag
My 27 video games

Gotta go, baby
Does it show?
I won't take honey
Anymore
Does it show, baby?
Gotta go
I'll pack my shoes and clothes
And take away my paper rose

Gotta go (gotta go)
Gotta go
Gotta go (gotta go)
Gotta go
Gotta go (gotta go)
Gotta go
I just don't wanna think about it
I just wanna go

Just watch that I don't come back to getcha
I don't need at all an alibi
You never tried now to keep me happy baby
Now it's time for me to break the ties
I'll come back to getcha
I'll come back, you betcha
Just forget me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Does it show, baby?
Gotta go
I don't feel, baby
Anymore
Gotta go, honey
Gotta go
And I'll put in my bag
My 27 video games

Just watch that I don't come back to getcha
I don't need at all an alibi
You never tried now to keep me happy baby
Now it's time for me to break the ties
I'll come back to getcha
I'll come back, you betcha
Just forget me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh

Gotta go baby
Does it show?
I won't take honey
Anymore
Does it show, baby?
Gotta go

And take away my paper rose

Gotta go (gotta go)

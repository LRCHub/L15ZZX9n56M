Pay attention
Yo, SB (holiday season, nigga)
I think it's my time
You know why? (Go hard)
My tears have dried
And I know that no weapon formed against me will prosper (go hard)
And I truly believe that my haters are my motivators
Young Money (holiday season)

If you could, you would get rid of me
Fuck you gon' do when a bitch try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (to me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another girl sit in your throne
I done put the chokehold
Now they screamin', "Nicki leave me alone"
I am (hard), I'm still (hard) the one to beat (go hard)
Ain't in a rush for mainstream, I am the streets (oh)
I am getting it in until the end
I gotta go (go), go (go), go (oh)
Go hard

Gotta go, lemme get the car key
You don't want it with the Harajuku Barbie
Keep a marquee, everything sparkly (man down)
Hit him on the walkie-talkie
Hit 'em, hit em, knock-knock, tell 'em let me in
My name ring bells, bitch buzz me in (bzzz)
And I only stop for pedestrians (oh)
Or a real, real bad lesbian

Hit 'em with the MAC, hit 'em with the TEC-nine
Hit 'em with the Ruger, by the intersect sign
Hit 'em with a Tommy, so my niggas call me Pammy
And I always keep the jammy
In the trunk or in the Lamby

Put my whole borough on my back and I'm good
I don't wanna hear what you would, what you could
I represent all the girls that stood up (uh)
Used to drink water with a little bit of sugar (oh)
Now I'm in the gym with my squats and my sit-ups (one, two)
Doing the scissor-leg, on the mat, with my foot up
Young black pin-up, all of my bitches did up
Now I'm tellin' LA Reid to step his bid up
And I'm tellin' President Carter, he picked a winner
Bitches like Nelly and Kelly got a dilemma (uh)
These birds all fly south, in the winter
Fuck I look like? Chomping on a chicken dinner?

You can hate me, but why knock my hustle?
I'ma be the queen, no matter how they shuffle
Skirts with the ruffle (yeah), Louis on the duffle (yeah)
I'm a bad bitch, no muzzle
(Hahahahahaha, no muzzle)

Bitches is softer than Al Dente
Cut from a different kente
Tell 'em I'm the ninja, Weezy is my Sensei
So I call him Splinter, faster than a sprinter
Gimme my chopsticks, I'll have these rap bitches for dinner

This is for my gentlemen, in button-ups, and khakis
This is for my nigga, Seven Up, in Castaki
This is for my niggas, wheelie-in' them Kawasakis
Shout out to the Vackee's, saltfish ackees (ackees)

Kisses to my fans, unless I'm feelin', kinda cocky (cocky)
Winter Wonderland, is on my hand, it's kind of rocky (rocky)
I am Nicki (Nicki), Minaj or Lewinski (Lewinski)
Pump's on the clutch, right hand, on the 6-speed (6-speed)
Write my own raps, I gotta go, I gotta get me (gotta get me)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

If you could, you would get rid of me
Fuck you gon' do when a bitch try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (to me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another girl sit in your throne
I done put the chokehold on
Now they screamin', "Nicki leave me alone"
I am (hard), I will (hard), I gots to win (go hard)
I'm still looking around for my competition (oh)
I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go (go), go (go), go (oh)
Go hard

From slap-and-cry you start to die
So I must go harder
Gotta make these bitches know me
Just like Bobby know water
Better yet, like Bubba know shrimp
But he don't say shit when the gun on his lip
And I don't say shit, put the gun on my hip
So I don't say shit but the gun on my hip

If you don't wanna drown, don't come on my ship
Check out how them bitches just run on my dick
And me, I'm still nasty as a son of a bitch
I still got that bitch cum on my lips
If you ain't got money, don't come on my strip
And if you got money, don't come on my strip
I wear that metal, no Olympic
But I can still make you tumble and flip

You fuckin' with me if you fuckin' with Nic'
They ain't fuckin' with me, they ain't fuckin' with Nic'
Your girlfriend her decision is split
'Cause she wanna fuck me and she wanna fuck Nic'
They wonder if he be fuckin' Nic', as long as she be fuckin' rich
That's why I keep my luggage 'cause I swear y'all a fuckin' trip

Young Money dungeon bitch, my swagger is punchin' bitch
And I shoot like I'm from overseas, so call my gun "Gunovich"
Weezy F Baby and the 'F' is for a bunch of shit
Red drank, blue pill, white dust, yes, I love my country, bitch
Ha-ha
Yeah (guitar)

Holiday Season

Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, ohh

Wish you could get rid of Young Money
Fuck you gon' do when a bitch try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (to me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you was as real as me you would never
Let another girl sit in your throne
I done put the chokehold on
Now they screamin', "Nicki leave me alone"
I am (hard), I will (hard), I gots to win (go hard)
I'm still lookin' around for my competition
I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go (go), go (go), go (oh)
Go hard
